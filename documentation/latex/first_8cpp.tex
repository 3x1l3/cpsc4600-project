\subsection{Detailed Description}
The definition for the \hyperlink{classFirst}{First} set-\/collection object and functions. This class is a deceptively simple one. The \hyperlink{classFirst}{First} object is really just a collection of functions within an easily modifiable class structure that returns the \char`\"{}First set\char`\"{} of a given Nonterminal.

Which is to say, the \char`\"{}first\char`\"{} terminals of a given Nonterminal (or, in our case, function) is returned.

For each of the following functions, a base set or sets are created with the appropriate set values corresponding to the \hyperlink{classFirst}{First} set for the given nonterminal that each function represents (by name). After this, sets are created using the mUnion of the given function set with the following productions' first sets.

Finally, the static functions return the given sets and are accessible without the calss being instantiated.
