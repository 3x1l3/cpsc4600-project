\subsection{Detailed Description}
The main \char`\"{}runner\char`\"{} file for the overall Compiler Project. Currently, we only employ a \hyperlink{classScanner}{Scanner} which constructs a Symbol Table. This is accomplished through an included Administration class.

We use a standard set of files and an Administration and \hyperlink{classToken}{Token} Classes to run the base \hyperlink{classScanner}{Scanner}.

We have a static text file containing our sample PL code in the Root directory. This code is then sent into a string which we forward to our constructors for the scanner and admin.

We use local file for now to speed up testing and debugging. At a later date, it will read it from the argc and argv vars.

This file has no associated header.

Read the file to a stream, then send each line to a String. We append our own newline and attach this to our whole File string. Repeat until we reach the end of the file. This might have scaling issues.

We check to see if there was an input parameter, and use that as the filename We do NOT accept multiple inputs (yet?). Choose the first one if multiple detected. If none, then ask for a file name.

We could incorporate an error class here, but for now, it is not necessary as this is not a compiler operation

We create our administration object with our file string. It then begins the Scanning process. We could also have some error handling here, but that is not required. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}
