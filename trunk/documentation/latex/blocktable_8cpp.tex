\subsection{Detailed Description}
The definitions for the \hyperlink{classAdmin}{Admin} Class Object. The \hyperlink{classBlockTable}{BlockTable} class manages a series and collection of Blocks. A Block is a collection of \hyperlink{structTableEntry}{TableEntry} records, which detail a specific semantic object -\/ such as \char`\"{}X\char`\"{}, which is an Integer of (value) 5.

The ancilliary functions allow us to keep track of the current variables and properly check for scope issues and problems by checking for any previous declarations of a current object, and checking for consistency (i.e. that an Integer operation is being applied to an int).

This is accomplished at parse-\/time by constructing and verifying \hyperlink{structTableEntry}{TableEntry} information through a single-\/access to the Scanner's symbol table.
