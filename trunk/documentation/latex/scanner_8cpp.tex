The definition(s) for the \hyperlink{classScanner}{Scanner} object.  


{\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}scanner.h\char`\"{}}\par


\subsection{Detailed Description}
The definition(s) for the \hyperlink{classScanner}{Scanner} object. The scanner coordinates the reading of characters from the file and the construction of tokens from those characters. It mediates \char`\"{}type\char`\"{} disputes and potential flawed or irregular inputs, and constructs the appropriate tokens to address these situations.

Finally, it facilitates communication between the Parser and the original source string. Future extensibility is afforded by accessors/mutators and extensible switches for types.
