The function and object definition file for the \hyperlink{classSet}{Set} class.  


{\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}set.h\char`\"{}}\par


\subsection{Detailed Description}
The function and object definition file for the \hyperlink{classSet}{Set} class. The \hyperlink{classSet}{Set} class is essentially a wrapper for a Vector of Strings that we use to get a more logical representation of a \char`\"{}set\char`\"{};

That is to say, a mathematical set \{ \char`\"{}a\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}b\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}c\char`\"{}, ...\} of lexemes or other string-\/represented values. Lexemetic values are stored for the \hyperlink{classParser}{Parser} to use.

Functions are provided to created mutual unions (munions) of existing sets, as well as various other \hyperlink{classSet}{Set} operations. Though not all; only what the \hyperlink{classParser}{Parser} needs.

Note that the Doxygen function comments have implicit briefs.
