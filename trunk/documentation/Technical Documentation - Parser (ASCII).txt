=============================================


It should be explicitly noted that, as specified in the README, this documentation is
 created and exists apart from the original Scanner documentation.

The reason for this is that is allows us to maintain the original documentation in an
unperturbed and accurate version of the original documentation for specific scanner components,
and allows us to maintain the insights into certain design decisions that may conflict or 
may result in seemingly confusing design choices for future versions of the compiler.

Which is to say, at the moment, certain components of the Scanner are not explicitly/directly
used or used differently or altered by the Parser;

The major change in the program structure, apart from adding the Parsing components, is that
the Parser itself now controls the call to the Scanner's Scan() function through the Admin object.

However, Admin's error handling and various wrappings around the Scanner are still applied, so
there is not much (at the current stage) in the way of a specific shift in regards to how the 
Scanning is completed and where and when and why.

While the Scanner is now invoked by the Parser during the (logical) construction of the Parse tree,
the Scanner's internal representation is near-wholly unchanged apart from corrections to some 
tokenizing functions and return variables.

The Scanner still performs and functions essentially the same as it had before, which is why it seems
best to keep the Parser's uniqueness (and the following changes to the other classes such as Admin)
within this distinct, easier to "parse" Documentation file.

At a later dat, such as the final revision of the Parser, the documentation as a whole may be combined
or refined into a final format and representation.
